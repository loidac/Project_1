# Project_1

This is the final project when I took Tech-Moms class. I was mostly done with it and just playing with the finishing touches. I asked a cohort (Carolyn) to give me feedback on this website I was working on and she gave me great suggestions. I applied those comments to the best of my knowledge (and skill I can attempt to apply at the time).
I had trouble getting github working because I played with the settings and changing things here and there. As a saving tactic, I cloned my final project to and continued troubleshooting my problem. I ended up getting things fixed and not needing the clone. I am still glad that happend because I learned a few things along the way. Also, I have now another thing to work on. I want to make my page fully responsive. So while, I am busy working on getting into a program and finaizing my project, I have something waiting for me to continue learning on my own. If I mess this up, I have the other one to use and pass. If not, I will use this for my graduation. Overall, it's a win-win for me.
